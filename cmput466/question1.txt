Thought question 1

1.Does any of the Gaussian distribution can be represented by a Gamma distribution?

possible answer: Yes, Gamma distribution can represente all Gaussian distribution, there should be a shape in gamma distribution that is same as any gamma distribution.

2. I have read an essay and is said mixture of Gaussian distribution "can be used to approximate arbitrarily close all continuous functions on a bounded set." I don't know whether it is correct.

possible answer: I think it could be right, because if there is enough number of Gaussion distribution to be mixed, all the function can be represented.

3.Does the gradient descent usually get the local optimum?

possible answer:  The gradient descent indeed usually get the local optimum because the optimize process of GD is one way. Somehow, normal GD will be trapped in a local minimum, so there are some better method like stochastic gradient descent raised to solve global optimum questions.
