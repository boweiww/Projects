cmput466 assignment2 question2
(a): 
I have kept increasing the number of features and I found when the number of features comes to 80, it does not work anymore.
An error happened. It says :
"  raise LinAlgError("Singular matrix")  numpy.linalg.linalg.LinAlgError: Singular matrix"
It does not work for any feature number in between 80-385.

(b)standard error is reported

(c)Ridge Regression is added.
Different from feature select linear regression in (a), even all the features are included, there is no error.
The reason is that when the feature number becomes larger, the product of XT¡¤X could be sigular matrix and cannot be inversed.
However in ridge regression, an identity matrix * lambda will be added to XT¡¤X that aviod the sigular case.

(d)Lasso is added

(e)SGD is added, the Average error for SGD is : 0.24847505429459588, standard error for SGD is : 0.00012867571444407378

(f)batch gradient descent added
The error decreases for batch gradient and slightly increases for stochastic gradient descent as the epoch increase, but the standard error for both are decrease. 

Besides, as you increase the number of epoch, the running time also increases, that means for batch gradient descent, the error decreases as the running time becomes longer.
